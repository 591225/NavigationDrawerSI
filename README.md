NavigationDrawerSI
==================

A Navigation Drawer Simple Implementation is an example of using a New/Bind pattern presented by Jake Wharton and a ButterKnife library (also by Jake Wharton) to create a simple Navigation Drawer implementation.

The Navigation Drawer pattern was built according to Google Play Navigation Drawer, but it did not cover it in 100%.
